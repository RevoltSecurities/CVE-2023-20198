# CVE-2023-20198
An Exploitation script developed to exploit the CVE-2023-20198 Cisco zero day vulnerability on their IOS XE

Hackers have been widely exploiting the this vulnerability which creates a 15 level privilege user by bypassing the authentication
Which a malicous xml content make this exploitation the webui endpoint of cisco.This is not only for Exploitation also detects
vulneable implant for exploitations and The tool can also use for mass detectiona and exploitation!.

# Information:

Since the exploitation and detection tool is developed by theoritical poc by [Horizona3](https://www.horizon3.ai/cisco-ios-xe-cve-2023-20198-deep-dive-and-poc/)https://www.horizon3.ai/cisco-ios-xe-cve-2023-20198-deep-dive-and-poc/Imp which is help me to develop this 
tool for this CVE and for detection it can detect the vulnerable cisco implant but for proper exploitation users needs to pass the malicous XML content that is is theoritical poc of horizona3 need
to be given by users for exploitations because of only theoritical explaination have to do this but soon after proper information and resources will upgrade this exploitation and detection Tool


# Warning:
Important thing if any unethical exploitation the I'm not responsible for any illegal actions so plese use this for ethical and legal 
purposes
